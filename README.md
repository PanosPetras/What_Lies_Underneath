This is a project i did back in 2019

It's created in Unreal Engine 4 using C++

It's a sandbox submarine game set in World War one. There are also some missions that the player can activate. Like locating another submarine that's declared missing and more.
The main objective of the game is to sink enemy transport ships and their escorts, in order to reduce the supplies that make it to the British Isles.
